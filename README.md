# FamilyCode

This repository contains the code used for a manuscript "Predicting the DNA binding specificity of mutated transcription factors using family-level biophysically interpretable machine learning" that is currently under review. The code was written by Shaoxun Liu under the supervision of Harmen J. Bussemaker in the Department of Biological Sciences at Columbia University. It has benefited from previous work by Pilar Gomez-Alcala and Christ Leemans.
